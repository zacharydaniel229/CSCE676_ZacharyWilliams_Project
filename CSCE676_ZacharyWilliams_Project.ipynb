    "1. Wordbank-An open database of children's vocabulary development\n",
    "- Supported data mining tasks: Text mining (course), embeddings (course), natural language processing (external)\n",
    "- Data quality issues: Some words are sounds such as \"baa baa\" which could lead to variations considered different words. However, the dataset seems well maintained so data quality is likely not an issue.\n",
    "- Algorithmic feasibility: Because of the size of the dataset, some algorithms may not work on the full dataset. A sample will likely need to be taken. This may be fine if we want to sample a certain word or certain child for our analysis.\n",
    "- Bias considerations: Socioeconomic factors about the children are not included in the database. We do not know if we are getting a good representation of all demographics and economic statuses. Children who's parents are more involved in their learning process are more likely to be included in this dataset because parents who are too busy or do not care will not try to seek out research like this.\n",
    "- Ethical considerations: If we predict baselines for how old children should be before learning certain words and our data is based on children with more opportunities do to their economic or social status, then we will falsely claim that most children are behind on their educational development and could cause children to believe they are less capable of learning with respect to their peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Youtube Video Social Graph\n",
    "- Supported data mining tasks: Graph Mining (course), PageRank (course), Community Detection (course), Link Prediction (external)\n",
    "- Data quality issues: Youtubers can change their channel or video names during the collection process since it took place over such a large period of time. Videos and channels also could have been deleted during that time. Comments and ratings are very commonly fabricated on Youtube as well. The Youtuber can choose the video category themselves and sometimes they may choose one that representents their channel as a whole rather than the video itself.\n",
    "- Algorithmic feasibility: It may be difficult to create a graph of millions of nodes. Because there are so many files, the graph may not fully connect. Choosing a few crawls and analyzing them seperately may be the best option.\n",
    "- Ethical considerations: The recommended age or potential objectionable content is not a feature of this dataset so harmful content may be shown to minors.\n",

    "3. Amazon Sales Dataset\n",
    "- Supported data mining tasks: Frequent Itemsets (course), Association Rules (course), Text mining (course), Sentiment-Augmented Rules (external)\n",
    "- Data quality issues: There are null values in some of the columns. Many of the columns are unorganized text. \n",
    "- Algorithmic feasibility: Trying text mining on such large paragraph may be difficult. However, the dataset is smaller than the other two candidates so there will likely not be any large issues.\n",
    "- Bias considerations: I do not know where they got this data from. It likely does not resemble amazon shoppers as a whole. Only a small number of amazon users actually leave reviews so the behavior of reviewers likely do not resemble the true population.\n",
    "- Ethical considerations: If a manufacturer inflates their product with fake reviews, then we may recommend faulty products to our users."
